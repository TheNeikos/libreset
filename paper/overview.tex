\section{Overview}

    The proposed data-structure is a hash-table which uses an amortised dynamic
    array for its list of buckets and AVLs as implementation for its buckets.
    While each bucket is a fully functional set on its own, splitting them into
    smaller domains with a maximum average number of elements reduces the
    average complexity for queries, insertions and other operations.

    This paper will discuss the algorithms used to implement each operation,
    drawing lines between the different levels, the overall hash-table and the
    buckets that is. Each operations description will also include a short
    derivation of the operations class of complexity.

    Additionally, we will discuss the possible use of bloom filters within this
    data-structure for early denyablity of an elements occurrence in the set.
