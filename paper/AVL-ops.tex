\section{AVL operations and algorithms}
\label{sec:AVL_ops}

    This section will discuss special operations on AVL trees. Basic operations
    like insertion, search and deletion will not be discussed in this document.
    In the following subsections, $n$ will denote the number of elements in the
    AVL.
    Furthermore, for each node a sufficiently small number of sub-elements will
    be assumed for the actual number to be irrelevant for the algorithms'
    classes of complexity.
