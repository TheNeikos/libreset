\section{Choice of parameters}
\label{sec:parameters}

    Along the description of algorithms the previous sections also contain
    estimates of the runtime the algorithms take to be performed.
    In most cases, the runtime depends on the number of elements involved.
    Since the set implementation described in this document consists of
    a hierarchy of data structures, the number of subdivisions in a layer
    can be influenced to optimize the overall runtime expected for an
    operation.

    The most interesting data structures in this respect are the hash table
    and the AVL tree.
    The fact that the AVL tree incorporates bloom filters for each subtree has
    a positive impact on the runtime complexity of many operations.
